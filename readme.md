First, an apology. Everything but the most basic stuff in this theme I learned how to make as I was making it, so I'm sure there are very few best practices and very many weird artifacts to be found.

The theme is also much more London than Manhattan: built up haphazardly over time, adding pieces as they were needed with no regard to any sort of central plan. So yeah, forgive the very messy code you're about to encounter.

BUT, if you can stomach that, I could really use your help (clearly). This is the code that runs Dailies.gg (fka TheRocketDailies.com). It is open source, with a weird sort of incentive/bounty program funded by the donations we receive. Basically there's a list of things I'd like done (the top two below, the rest in the "issues" tab) with bounties I'll pay out if you can do them. Or you could always donate your expertise, we're crowd-funded so the whole community will appreciate it/shower you with love and adoration.

Here are the two main bounties:

***Fix an Exploit of the Voting Code: $50***
If you can find and fix a way to exploit our voting system, there's $50 in it for you. If you just find the exploit but don't feel like fixing it, there's $10.

***Redesign the site: $25***
Major redesigns get the full $25, but if you just redesign a certain chunk, we'll pay out $5. So if you think you've got a better way of styling things, send it along. Or if you want to really go to town and redo the whole site, definitely send that along. I'm not a designer, so it shouldn't really be too hard to improve on all this.
