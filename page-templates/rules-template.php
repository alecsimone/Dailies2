	<h2>Rules</h2>

	<p class="rules"><span class="highlight">1. Plays will be eligible based on when I first see them</span>, not necessarily the day they were made</p>

	<p class="rules"><span class="highlight">2. Plays that aren't from tournaments are eligible, but they're at a huge disadvantage.</span> Tournaments have stakes. There's something on the line. Anyone can do crazy freestyles or weird shots in unranked where nobody cares if they miss. Having the courage to try when there's something to lose (and the confidence and wisdom to know when to try and when not to) give tournament play a HUGE leg up over casual or even ranked matches in my book.</p>

	<p class="rules"><span class="highlight">3. The play with the most votes wins, but I reserve the right to overrule this for any reason whatsoever.</span> Mostly I'll invoke this rule to prevent cheating or brigading, but seriously: for any reason whatsoever.</p>

	<p class="rules"><span class="highlight">4. Retweets count as two votes, likes as one.</span> I'm willing to re-callibrate this if it seems unfair, but using twitter for voting is a short-term solution while we finish our website, so I'm not too worried about getting it exactly right.</p>

	<p class="rules"><span class="highlight">5.</span> If a goal has an assist, that doesn't automatically qualify the assister to split the prize, but if what they do is particularly cool I will include them. You can, of course, always share your prize with them yourself if you feel they deserve it.</p>

	<p class="rules"><span class="highlight">6. Commenting is a privilege that must be earned and maintained.</span> Be civil and thoughtful. Don't spam.</p>
