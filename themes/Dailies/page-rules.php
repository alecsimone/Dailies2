	<h2>Rules</h2>
	<p class="rules">1. Plays will be eligible based on when I first see them, not necessarily the day they were made</p>
	<p class="rules">2. I choose which plays to nominate. But plays that don't quite make the cut will go to the <a href="http://therocketdailies.com/underdogs">Underdogs</a> page. If they do well there, they might get nominated for the next day</p>
	<p class="rules">3. The play with the most votes wins, but I reserve the right to overrule this for any reason whatsoever. Mostly I'll invoke this rule to prevent cheating or brigading, but seriously: for any reason whatsoever.</p>
	<p class="rules">4. Commenting is a privilege that must be earned and maintained. Be civil and thoughtful. Don't spam.</p>
	<p class="rules">5. Privacy Policy:</p>
